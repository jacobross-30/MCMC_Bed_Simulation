# MCMC_Bed_Simulation
Overview:

This repository contains my workflow for generating probabilistic realizations of Ninnis Glacier’s subglacial topography using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework along with geostatistical simulation. This approach produces mass-conserving bed elevation realizations, allowing us to quantify uncertainty and explore the non-uniqueness inherent in subglacial topography. By constructing many plausible bed geometries, this method supports improved modeling of glacier dynamics, ice-sheet evolution, and sea-level contributions. We additionally compare our generated bed realizations with existing large-scale products, including Bedmap and BedMachine, to evaluate consistency, differences, and potential improvements in localized bed estimates for the Ninnis region.
